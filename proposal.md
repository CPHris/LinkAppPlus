## Reliability improvements

\*\*Front End:

- add unit tests
- code is looking good, in case there is need we will modularize code to smaller components
- fix that new link page can not have an id that is already in use
- update getServerSideProps to use dynamic urls
- look into converting all images to use next's image component
- refactor apiService.ts
  \*\*

\*\*Back End:

- add unit tests
- modularize
- clear up the error handling
- add hashed password to userschema
- improve response types to be more consistent
- create a .env file that contains the database data, routes, etc.
